        <h4> hi!</h3>
     
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-jumped-python-javascript-sowmya-aji/" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[How I jumped into Python and JS]</a>
            
       
                
                <p> It has been a long, strange journey of a dancer, theatreperson, some-time singer, hiker, typist, film technician, radio announcer, TV actress,
                    journalist, mother, knitter, writer and now, software developer.</p>
                <p style="float: left;" class="move"><a href="index.html"> <img src="images/side.jpg"></a></p>
                    <p> It has been fantastic so far, wending through the many curves, catching the curveballs  A lot of it has been fun, some, formidable.</p>
                <p>The latest twist in this roller-coaster ride is the one from journalist to developer. I loved being a journalist and I still am one,
                    occasionally.  Change has come, though and it is time to apply my thirst for knowledge and challenges to another sector.</p>
                <p>Technology has always puzzled me the most.  And scared me, witless.  I felt I  was getting out-of-sync with the world and I had to conquer this tech-fear. Then, I wondered.  What is the magic behind the screen on my laptop and phone?The minute I got curious, I knew my next step: software.</p>

                    gave me the break I needed. <a href="https://dreisbach.us/" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton
                        Dreisbach</a>, assisted by<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rlconley/" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">  Rebecca Conley</a> put us through the paces for three endless months and ensured that I, along with 15 of my classmates, learnt to program apps.</p>

                    <p>More on that coding journey <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-jumped-python-javascript-sowmya-aji/" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> I will, of course, keep adding to this tale. Do come back and keep in touch!</p>
