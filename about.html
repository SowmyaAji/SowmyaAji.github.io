    <h4><a href="index.html"> <img src="images/Sowmya.jpeg" class="linked"></a> hi! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-jumped-python-javascript-sowmya-aji/" class="black">[My bewildering journey into coding.]</a></h4>
        <h6 class="aboutstyle"><p>It has been a long, strange journey of a dancer, theatreperson, some-time singer, hiker, typist, film technician, radio announcer, TV actress,
            journalist, mother, knitter, writer and now, software developer.<a href="index.html"><img src="images/bull1.jpg"  align="right"></a></p>
        <p> It has been fantastic to wend through the many curves, catching the curveballs. A lot of it has been fun,
            some of it has been formidable to overcome.</p>
        <p>The latest twist in this roller-coaster ride is the one from journalist to developer. I loved being a journalist
            and I still am one,
            ocassionally. It is time for change, though. To apply my thirst for knowledge and challenges to another sector.</p>
        <p>I thought about it and decided that it was technology that puzzled me the most.  And scared me, witless. I was getting out-of-sync with the world and I had to conquer this fear.</p>
        <p> Then I had an epiphany: it was fascinating. What is the magic behind the screen on my laptop and phone? The minute I got curious, I knew: I would tackle technology head-on.</p>

            gave me the break I needed. <a href="https://dreisbach.us/" class="black">Clinton
                Dreisbach</a>, assisted by<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rlconley/" class="black"> Rebecca Conley</a> put us through the paces for three endless months and ensured that I, along with 15 of my classmates, learnt to program apps.</p>
                <p>They taught us to know the ropes of how to learn more and more, as technology changes every day. And to love it. </p>
            <p>More on that coding journey <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-jumped-python-javascript-sowmya-aji/" class="black">here.</a></p>
            <p>I will, of course, keep adding to this tale. Do come back and keep in touch!</p></h6>
