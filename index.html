                <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36562871-cinder-ella"><img src="images/cinder.jpg" class="left"></a>When
                    minister Sarthak Maadara, charming and suave,
                    walks into a slum in Bengaluru, he sets off deep political intrigue, violent ideological
                    battles, potent gang wars in the teeming life of the unreported and neglected underbelly of
                    India's Silicon city. This gritty political thriller gets as real as it can, living the grim life of
                    the modern-day Cinderella who protects her men and her ideals. Is this a fairy tale that can end
                    well?</p>

                    Karnataka guards a
                    dangerous mystery. Yet, four generations of women from the headman's family helpless
                    and spirited, headstrong and weak with desire have a wayward fascination with it. And
                    with Annaiah who comes, some say, from across the wall. Tradition and subversion
                    coexist with superstitions and the slow advent of modernity in this powerful novel
                    where time is a wilful beast and the gods walk among us.</p>

                    romance, the reporter within her sniffs out the biggest scoop of the season. All too soon, she is
                    neck-deep in trouble with her bosses and the cricket board, struggling to make sense of the sordid
                    world of steroids and celebs. Will anjana give up the delicious young man she is hooked on to? And
                    does she even want to? Sinful and alluring, Delirium is a heady cocktail of intrigue, temptation
                    and betrayal. </p>

                    a little too much and had read that letter every single day for the last three years? He tried to
                    go about his daily businesses like any other person—eventually, he would be capable of managing
                    without her, right?—but, every now and then, sadness engulfed him. What choice did he have? </p>
