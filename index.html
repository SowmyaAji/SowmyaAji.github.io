                    <h4> hi!</h4>
                    <a href="SADev.html" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My resume</a>
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-jumped-python-javascript-sowmya-aji/" class="tag"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[How I jumped into Python and JS]</a>

                    <br>

                    <p> It has been a long, strange journey of a dancer, theatreperson, wannabe-cricketer, some-time
                        singer,
                        hiker, typist, film technician, radio announcer, TV actress,
                        journalist, mother, knitter, writer and now, software developer.</p>

                    <p> It has been fantastic so far, wending through the many curves, catching the curveballs A lot of
                        it
                        has been fun, some, formidable.</p>
                    <p>The latest twist in this roller-coaster ride is the one from journalist to developer. I loved
                        being a
                        journalist and I still am one,
                        occasionally. Change has come, though and it is time to apply my thirst for knowledge and
                        challenges
                        to another sector.</p>
                    <p>Technology has always puzzled me the most. And scared me, witless. I felt I was getting
                        out-of-sync
                        with the world and I had to conquer this tech-fear. Then, I wondered. What is the magic behind
                        the
                        screen on my laptop and phone?The minute I got curious, I knew my next step: software.</p>

                            and betrayal. </p>
